Mini Nav Mode
=============

Adds a keyboard shortcut (by default, "N") which will toggle map
zoom-to-player mode at the player's current location.

This mod is inspired by navigation satellite mode in [Space Exploration][1],
but uses a much simpler implementation. If you are familiar with that mod, you
should be aware of some limitations:

  * Mini nav mode uses the map zoom-to-world mode, not editor mode. As such,
    it does not have its own inventory, cannot see through the fog of war, and
    cannot create entity ghosts without an item, a blueprint, or using the
    pipette tool.

  * Mini nav mode is not compatible with Space Exploration. Use that mod's
    navigation mode instead.

  * Mini nav mode cannot remotely view other surfaces, like the interiors of
    Factorissimo factories.
